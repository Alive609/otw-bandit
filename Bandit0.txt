-----------------------------------Welcome Message--------------------------------------------
	Welcome to OverTheWire!

	If you find any problems, please report them to Steven or morla on
	irc.overthewire.org.

	--[ Playing the games ]--

	  This machine might hold several wargames.
	  If you are playing "somegame", then:

		* USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
		* Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
		* PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

	  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
	  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
	  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
	  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ and /proc/ is disabled
	  so that users can not snoop on eachother. Files and directories with
	  easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted!

	  Please play nice:

		* don't leave orphan processes running
		* don't leave exploit-files laying around
		* don't annoy other players
		* don't post passwords or spoilers
		* again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
		  This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

	--[ Tips ]--

	  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
	  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
	  compiler flags might be interesting:

		-m32                    compile for 32bit
		-fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
		-Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

	  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
	  executable on ELF binaries.

	  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
	  firewall.

	--[ Tools ]--

	 For your convenience we have installed a few usefull tools which you can find
	 in the following locations:

		* pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /usr/local/pwndbg/
		* peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /usr/local/peda/
		* gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /usr/local/gdbinit/
		* pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
		* radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)
		* checksec.sh (http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html) in /usr/local/bin/checksec.sh

Level Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory.
Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH.
Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

Useful Commands:
ls - list directory contents (man ls)
cd - change shell working directory (help cd)
cat - concatenate files and print to standard output (man cat)
file - determine file type (man file)
du - estimate file space usage (man du)
find - search for file in a directory (man find)

Solution:
#pwd
/home/bandit0
#ls -l
readme file is the only thing in the directory
#cat readme
