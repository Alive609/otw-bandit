## OverTheWire Bandit Solutions
This repository represents a way to keep track of my solutions to their Bandit (http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) exercises.

I am also using this a way to get familiar with using Git and the various commands to manage remote/local repositories.

Note: I name the text files as the level you start on (or login as). The links to the offical level goals go by what level you are getting to (getting the password for).
For example, if I am logging into bandit15, I consider that level 15; therefore, I name my solution Bandit15.txt.
However, the URL for the level description indicates that it is level 16, http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit16.html

I did what makes sense to me. Just thought it was worth an explaination to avoid future confusion.

I have nothing to do with the OverTheWire (http://overthewire.org) team. I am simply a user of their excellent service.
