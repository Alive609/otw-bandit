Level Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.

Useful Commands:
ls - list directory contents (man ls)
cd - change shell working directory (help cd)
cat - concatenate files and print to standard output (man cat)
file - determine file type (man file)
du - estimate file space usage (man du)
find - search for file in a directory (man find)
